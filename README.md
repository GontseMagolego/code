# My Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio

My name is Gontse Magolego, I am a data analyst with extensive knowledge in the data science field. I am able to take any type of raw data to give valuable insights to businesses and industries. I am knowledgable in Tableau, Excel, various Python Frameworks and I am aware of new technologies in my industry such as PandasAI. I have a deep understanding of data science techniques such as data scraping, data cleaning, data analysis and dashboard creation, as well as a little machine learning in my arsenal.

My portfolio includes projects I have done that showcase my skills. I purposely chose business related data as that is what I am passionate about, the data I used includes from RFM analysis and some sales data. I believe these projects will fully show my analytics skills and my ability to turn data into something that is easy to understand for others as well, I also advice shareholders on how to use the data for their business.

The projects I included cover topics on data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization and machine learning in one instance. I hope you find my portfolio engaging and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
