This data analysis project is focused towards RFM analysis which is important to businesses. I first cleaned and analyzed the data which I had, I then imported necessary machine learning libraries to perform kmeans on my data. It gave me clusters which I named Whales, Fishes, Dolphins and Turtles.

As you can see from the data, Whales means the customer(s) which have huge monetary value but are less recent, Fishes represent little monetary value, recency and frequency, Dolphins have high recency, average frequency and average monetary value, Turtles have low recency, average frequency and high monetary value.

Given this data the business can run promotions for the Whales as they have low recency and they can convince them to shop again, Fishes are less frequent and they have little monetary value so they are not as prioritized as the other segments, Dolphins shop more than the other segments but they have a slightly less monetary value so businesses can choose to run discounts for them, Turtles are average customers that have the second highest monetary value so they should be prioritized like the whales.
