This Project is a data cleaning and analysis project that shows a businesses sales for the year 2019. As you can see from the dashboard the month that has the highest amount of sales is December, this can be because December is the festive season. The lowest amount of sales is in January, this can be because the previous month is where people spent majority of their money.

Businesses can tailor their marketing to market their products in months where sales are excpected to spike as there will be competition in those months.
